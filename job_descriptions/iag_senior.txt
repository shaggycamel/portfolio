IAG | Senior Fraud Analyst &#013; &nbsp; &#013; Using ML & NLP techniques to rapidly and accurately identify fraudulent behaviour for Australasia's largest general insurer, with a particular focus on organised crime. &#013; &nbsp; &#013; The Excess Claims Frequency Model project was an anomaly detection model used to classify the “riskyness” of claims lodged within three days of policy inception. This type of suspicious claim is by far the most common, some of which aren’t economical to pursue or of concern. The model categorised claims as low, medium and high risk allowing investigators to focus efforts on medium and high risk claims. This model garnered a lot of success, and was redeveloped to be applied upon claims lodged within four to fourteen days. &#013; &nbsp; &#013; The Claim Description Comparison project focused on identifying organised crime syndicates, who have been known to recycle claim descriptions. It worked by clustering common claim descriptions using cosine similarity, then further comparing the profile of policy, claim and vehicle configurations between common descriptions using jaccard similarity.
