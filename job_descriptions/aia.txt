AIA | Insights Analyst &#013; &nbsp; &#013; My contract at AIA concerned establishing an infrastructure that processes data to be used for Fraud detection, and using this to build a model that quantifies the probability of risk leakage upon newly lodged claims. Analysis was used to dictate the direction of a new online claim lodgement system AIA were introducing to different customer cohorts. &#013; &nbsp; &#013; The process entailed using dynamic SQL to integrate a new data pipeline into the existing architect. Output of newly established fraud business rules was visualised using Tableau and stored as a dashboard on AIAâ€™s server, giving internal fraud- investigators an opportunity to make more-informed decisions on claim investigation outcome. &#013; &nbsp; &#013; Additionally, a machine learning model was built using R to estimate the probability a claim is approved or not upon lodgement. Analysis was used to help choose customer cohorts a new automated online claim lodgement platform is released to.
