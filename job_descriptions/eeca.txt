EECA | Data Scientist &#013; &nbsp; &#013; EECA is a government agency that monitors and measures carbon emission & abatement within New Zealand. Their business model involves collaborating with large emitters and providing funding and suggestions for reducing carbon emissions. &#013; &nbsp; &#013; My main focus was engineering a data platform to be used for analysis within the organisation. A major component of this was educating fellow employees on how to efficiently layout and structure project data, which was saved in Excel files, so it could be efficiently processed through the ETL pipeline my team & I were constructing. This involved using SQL and Python, utilising the Azure Cloud environment and managing DB-project files using MS-Studio. I also built a Python package for internal use within the organisation to automate tedious and labourious tasks. &#013; &nbsp; &#013; Another focus at EECA was building and maintaining Rshiny dashboards for consumption by the New Zealand public. For example, the Regional Heat Demand Dashboard, which breakdowns fuel demand for process heat (industrial boilers) by region & sector.
