EECA | Data Scientist &#013; &nbsp; &#013; EECA is a government agency established to monitor and measure carbon emissions & abatement within New Zealand. Their business model involves collaborating with large emitters and providing funding and suggestions for reducing carbon emissions. &#013; &nbsp; &#013; My main focus here is engineering a modern data platform to be used for analysis within the organisation. Other analytical projects Iâ€™ve worked on are: &#013; &nbsp; &#013; &bull; The Regional Heat Demand Dashboard. This dashboard breakdowns fuel demand for process heat (industrial boilers) by region. The application is built using the Rshiny infrastructure. &#013; &nbsp; &#013; &bull; Desensitising electrical vehicle (EV) location data. Thirty EVs owned by the government have been leased out to various government agencies. I was required to remove GPS co-ordinates from vehicle log-records that fall within the SA2 area of the allocated drivers home. This ensured subsequent analysis conducted on this dataset will not contain personally identifiable information of drivers.
