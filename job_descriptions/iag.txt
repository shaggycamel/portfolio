IAG | Fraud Analyst &#013; &nbsp; &#013; Modelling and reporting on the performance of existing fraud rules. &#013; &nbsp; &#013; The inferential modelling of rule performance consisted of fitting a GLMnet model on alerted claims, where investigation flag was the dependent variable, and from this determining which rules were contributing towards alerts being investigated. Such an approach may be deemed somewhat unnecessary, however it was the best way to isolate specific rule performance particularly when a single claim can raise multiple flags. Identifying low performing rules this way acted as a catalyst towards rule amendment & experimentation. &#013; &nbsp; &#013; Another important piece of analysis concerned conducting ethics reviews of existing and new rules. This analysis aimed to answer the question: do IAG fraud rules inadvertently target population subgroups, such as gender, age, ethnicity and socioeconomic status? Ethnicity and socioeconomic data was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Modelling for the ethics review consisted of first fitting a poisson regression model, with alert flag as the dependent variable to identify which population subgroups were over-represented in alert count. Next, relevant regression models (linear for age, logistic for gender, quantile for ethnicity & polr for socieconomic status) were fit with the population subgroup as the dependent variable, and rule flags as independent variables. This way specific rules could be identified as unfairly targeting population subgroups.
