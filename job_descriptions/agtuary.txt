Agtuary | Data Scientist &#013; &nbsp; &#013; My time at Agtuary was part of a work experience course through University. I was tasked with finding a way to induce patterns from remote sensing satellite images in order to predict annual crop yield across Australian farms.  &#013; &nbsp; &#013; As a deliverable, Agtuary required a module that allowed crop yield predictions to be made, and in the process, outputting predictions, model metrics and model parameters to file.  &#013; &nbsp; &#013; After experimenting, the final model was an XGBoost model with Hyperopt tuning. Due to the small sample of training data, observations were simulated using the Prophet module (developed by Facebook). I believe the simulated data points are what drove the success of this model.
