Beca | Senior Asset Technician &#013; &nbsp; &#013; Beca is an engineering consulting firm. My contract at Beca was spent in the civil engineering space running adhoc analysis on road condition data for national & council road networks. This entailed processing large datasets to observe annual trends of the length of road repairs undertaken, what type of repairs took place and where future repair efforts should be focused. Other analysis also included modelling traffic volume count which utilised data collected from pneumatic tubes laid across roads and cycleways. Analysis was usually presented in a dynamic dashboard, built using Shiny or PowerBi, or creating static plots as pngs to be inserted within a power point presentation.
